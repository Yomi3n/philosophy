Why do you choose to help?
Some people may point that helping others can give us reward because others will help us back. Or eventually, there will be a warm atmosphere that everyone is ready to help in the society.
So it's beneficial to us everyone. That's to say, we help others because we can get help someday. But if we couldn't get help back, will you still chosse to helpï¼Ÿ

Now I give another explanation for this altruistic behavior. We help others because we can feel how miserable those people are. We've experienced the same desperate or anxious moments before and we don't want them to go through again.
